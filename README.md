# Daily Scheduler

## Description

I built this project so that anyone who needs a daily scheduler can utilize said project to keep organized. I learned to understand how for-loops work and how to create a for-loop. I learned how to pull from the local storage and how to save text so that it persists despite a refresh. 

## Installation

One can install my project by going to GitHub and then access my repositories: specifically the schedule respository. Select the green "CODE" button and copy the HTTPS url. Use the git clone command in the terminal to clone the respository, and lastly enter "CODE ." to open in Visual Studios. 

## Usage

The Schedule is fairly simple to utilize. The timeslots will update upon each hour with indicating colors: Green for future time, red for current time, and gray for past time. The user can enter any text into the description box and the text will save to the local storage and will persist upon refresh.
